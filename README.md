# Xamarin vs Flutter
Xamarin &amp; Flutter micro projects to see how they differ

## Assets
[Flutter demo](https://github.com/lewixlabs/Xamarin-vs-Flutter/tree/master/assets_challenge) shows how flutter can handle file resources (images, fonts, etc) in a single yaml config file

## Size
With a simple Rest Api, [Xamarin project](https://github.com/lewixlabs/Xamarin-vs-Flutter/tree/master/size_challenge/xamarin/size_challenge) app size is [twice bigger](https://github.com/lewixlabs/Xamarin-vs-Flutter/tree/master/size_challenge/release%20builds) than [Flutter project](https://github.com/lewixlabs/Xamarin-vs-Flutter/tree/master/size_challenge/flutter/size_challenge)
